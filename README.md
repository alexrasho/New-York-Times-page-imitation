# NewYorkTimesImitation

All material labeled under "CSS File" was mistakenly labeled as such, it is the content for the first screenshot.
All material labeled Screenshot #2 is the work submitted for the second screenshot. They were done in seperate html files mistakenly.

So there's 2 html files and 2 CSS Files and a file called OldLondon.woff that is imported to bring out the New York Times Text family.

Atom Beautify- broke some of my code on the 2nd HTML page so i performed it on all of the other content besides one line. I don't know how this happened and couldn't figure out how the meaningless spaces broke it.
