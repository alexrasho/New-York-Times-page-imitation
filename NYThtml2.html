      <p3>- What is a home delivery subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?</p3><br>
      <p4>As a home delivery subscriber to The New York Times you enjoy the convenience and reliability of having the printed newspaper delivered to you first thing in the morning. Your subscription includes free Digital Access, which brings you unlimited access to NYTimes.com and full access to the NYT app for smartphones and tablets. You can also share your Digital Access with a family member at no additional charge.<br><br>
Home delivery subscribers also have free access to The New York Times Archive, featuring every article published since 1851; Times Digest, a 10-page summary of the top stories of The Times, emailed daily; and The New York Times Replica Edition, an exact digital replica of the printed paper that you can read online or offline - even when you are not connected to the internet. We also make it easy for you to suspend home delivery service while you're away on vacation. </p4>
